=============================================================
Description:

This work was inspired by the project 8Bit-Day (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/1tqe9k/update_new_version_of_the_8bit_day_wallpaper_set/). It consists of multiple 8bit wallpapers where the main idea is to change your desktop background to one of these, depending on the time of day. 
You can also look at the original project here: http://www.bitday.me/download/ where all the wallpapers are available for download, as well as installation instructions for the automatic changer setup.

However, the installation instructions for linux are not present there, and since I was also unable to find them anywhere else, I decided to make my own script, which is what this side-project is about. 
I was running this under Linux Mint 18.3 (cinnamon). Other distros might need a bit of tweaking in the .py file to make the wallpaper swapping work. 

=============================================================
Requirements:
-Python ver.3 installed 

=============================================================
Included in this project are:
- 12 8bitday unique wallpapers from the bitday.me page
- the script
- instructions for setting up the script to change the background automatically thorough the day (INSTRUCTIONS.txt)


Disclaimer:
The BitDay project and the wallpapers do not belong to me and all credit goes to their authors. The only part of this work which is mine is the script.
