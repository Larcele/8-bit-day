----Make sure you have Python3 installed----


==========================================
SHORT instructions:
open the main.py file and set the PATH variable to where all the files associated with this project are
(i.e "/home/[username]/Documents.../")
edit your crontab file to periodically run the script once an hour or two, as well as making the script run at startup, and you are done.


==========================================
DETAILED instructions:
open the main.py file and set the PATH variable to where all the files associated with this project are
(i.e "/home/[username]/Documents.../"). This enables the script to manipulate with the wallpaper images and setting the background.

Then, you need to set the script to be run periodically to change your BitDay wallpaper. From the terminal type "crontab -e". This will enable you to edit the contab file. The two lines you need to put at the end of the file are the following:
0 * * * * [python_location] [script_file_path]
@reboot [script_file_path]

where [python_location] is the path where python is installed on your machine (usually should be /usr/bin/python) and [script_file_path] is the full path to where your script is located (/home/[username]/.../main.py).
The first line makes the script run each hour, the second line ensures the script runs at startup.
